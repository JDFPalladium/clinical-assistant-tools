Pregnancy intention should be discussed with all women initiating ART regardless of regimen. Women who do not wish to become pregnant should be offered appropriate family planning counseling and methods.\n\n# Important Drug Interactions with DTG\n\n- Rifampicin\n- Rifampicin lowers DTG levels: increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are > 20 kg in body weight. Children &#x3C;20 kg taking DTG who require rifampicin should increase their weight-appropriate DTG dose to twice daily.\n- There are no significant drug interactions between DTG and other currently used anti-TB medications (including for MDR-TB).\n- Mineral supplements, including: antacids containing calcium, zinc, magnesium or aluminum; iron supplements; prenatal vitamins (which contain iron and calcium)\n- These supplements decrease the absorption of DTG: administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking any of these supplements.\n- Dose separation is not required for calcium and iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins) if DTG is taken with a meal.\n- It is critical to educate patients about this important drug interaction because many patients get these supplements and antacids over-the-counter without informing their healthcare provider.\n- Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n- These anticonvulsants decrease DTG levels: use a different anticonvulsant if available.\n- If DTG must be co-administered with these drugs then increase to DTG to twice daily, although there is little data to guide this.\n- If valproic acid is available this can be used with DTG without dose adjustment.\n- Metformin\n- DTG increases levels of metformin; the levels of DTG are not affected: use a lower dose of metformin (often 50% of usual dose) and monitor glycemic control. Use a maximum daily dose of metformin 1 g.\n- Other drug-drug interactions with DTG\n- See Annex 13C.\n\n\n\n# 6.5 Monitoring and Changing ART\n\nThe objectives of clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART are to identify and treat inter-current illnesses, assess for and manage adverse drug reactions, and evaluate response to treatment. Routine laboratory monitoring recommendations are described in Table 3.5; however, additional investigations should be ordered whenever there is clinical suspicion for which a laboratory test result may alter patient management.\n\nIndications for changing ART include optimizing therapy for patients who have undetectable viral load, managing adverse drug reactions or toxicity, drug-drug interactions, co-morbidities and treatment failure.\n\n# 6.5.1 Optimizing Therapy for Patients who have suppressed viral load on First Line ART\n\nPatients who are virally suppressed on first line ART may benefit from regimen optimization even if they are currently tolerating their regimen well and have no drug-drug interactions requiring a change. Regimen modifications may be done for age/weight transitions among children and adolescents &#x3C;15 years and to simplify a regimen, prevent long-term toxicity and improve cost-effectiveness. Dolutegravir has been shown to have superior tolerability and efficacy compared to efavirenz and lopinavir and is now preferred as part of first line ART for children, adolescents and adults. While most adults in Kenya have switched over to a DTG-containing regimen, proactive switching of children is now also recommended with the availability of a pediatric dispersible dolutegravir tablet.\n\nChildren and adolescents with suppressed viral load on first line ART and not on the recommended first line regimen as per Table 6.2 should be considered for optimization as per Figures 6.1 and 6.2, such as when children grow and enter a new weight band. This also includes PLHIV who recently initiated non-standard therapy (less than 3 months ago, before the first VL is due). Decisions on regimen modification should be made following discussion with the patient/caregiver.\n\nAlways discuss the possibility of new side effects when changing to a new ARV, particularly side effects common to all ARVs (headache, nausea, diarrhea) and any side effects specific to the new ARV. Reassure patients that most side effects resolve with continued use after 1-2 weeks.']","Important drug interactions with dolutegravir (DTG) include:

1. **Efavirenz**: Co-administration is not recommended because efavirenz decreases levels of DTG. If used together, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.

2. **Etravirine**: Co-administration is not recommended unless used with a PI/r. If used without a PI/r, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.

3. **Rifampicin**: Lowers DTG levels; increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily for patients on rifampicin who are over 20 kg in body weight.

4. **Rifapentine**: Potential decreased DTG levels; no dose adjustment required unless viral load becomes detectable.

5. **Anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)**: Avoid use as they decrease DTG plasma levels. If necessary, increase DTG dose to 50 mg twice daily and monitor viral load.

6. **Mineral supplements and antacids containing cations (e.g., calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, aluminum)**: Decrease absorption of DTG. Administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking these supplements. Dose separation is not required if DTG is taken with a meal.

7. **Metformin**: DTG may increase metformin plasma levels, so the metformin dose may need to be decreased. Limit daily metformin dose to 1,000 mg.

How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed
