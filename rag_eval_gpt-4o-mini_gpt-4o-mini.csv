DTG is well tolerated, highly efficacious, has a high genetic barrier to resistance and fewer drug-drug interactions.\n\nRecommended Dosing of DTG\n● &#x3C; 20 kg body weight: Use weight-based dosing with dispersible 10mg DTG tablets as per Annex 10\n● ≥ 20 kg body weight: DTG 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily, preferably as a morning dose. It is also available as part of FDC. Those unable to swallow the film coated tablets whole refer to Annex 10\n● For patients taking rifampicin: Increase DTG dosing frequency to twice daily for duration of rifampicin-containing TB treatment and for an additional 2 weeks after TB treatment is completed, then revert to once daily. (The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed)\n● For patients with suspected or confirmed INSTI resistance (e.g., patients with prior history of failing a RAL-based regimen): use DTG twice daily\n● DTG can be taken with or without food\n\n# Common Side Effects of DTG\n\n- The most common side effects of DTG are headache, nausea and diarrhea. These side effects usually resolve after continued use for 1-2 weeks. It is critical to inform patients / caregivers about these potential side effects and their temporary nature, and encourage them to continue their ART and consult a HCW if concerned.\n- Some patients on DTG are more likely to develop insomnia. This may be reduced by taking DTG as a morning dose, or by taking DTG with a low-fat meal or on an empty stomach.\n- DTG may cause a small rise in serum creatinine levels but this does NOT represent a true decline in renal function.\n- Integrase inhibitors, including DTG, are associated with increased weight gain. Counsel patients about healthy eating and physical activity and the benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n1 For other scenarios that are not covered in this table, discuss as an MDT and consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG (Uliza Hotline 0726 460 000; https://nhcsc.nascop.org/clinicalform)\n\n2 ABC hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is rare in the Kenyan population. Table 6.9 provides the definition and management of AHR\n\n3 The additional 2 weeks of higher-dose DTG is to counter the ongoing liver enzyme induction effect of rifampicin, which continues for a short period after TB treatment is completed\n\n4 TAF may become the preferred NRTI once fixed-dose combinations are available\n\n5 DTG/3TC dual therapy may be considered for HBV-negative patients once fixed-dose combinations are available']","Important drug interactions with dolutegravir (DTG) include:

1. **Efavirenz**: Co-administration not recommended as it decreases levels of DTG. If used together, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
2. **Etravirine**: Co-administration not recommended as it decreases levels of DTG. If used together without a protease inhibitor, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily.
3. **Rifampicin**: Increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily when co-administered.
4. **Rifapentine**: Potential decreased DTG levels; no dose adjustment required unless viral load becomes detectable, then increase DTG to twice daily.
5. **Anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin)**: Avoid use as they decrease DTG plasma levels. If necessary, increase DTG to 50 mg twice daily and monitor viral load.
6. **Metformin**: DTG may increase metformin plasma levels, so metformin dose may need to be decreased.

For mineral supplements and antacids containing cations, administer DTG at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking these supplements.",1.0,0.9645169828191099,"{'phi_redaction': 0.0004558563232421875, 'query_expansion': 1.4538068771362305, 'chunk_retrieval': 1.2427599430084229, 'reranking': 1.660884141921997, 'answer_generation': 7.637572288513184}"
How should PrEP be provided to adolescent girls?,"['# 11. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection by an uninfected person at ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nPrEP is recommended for use as follows:\n\n- Daily Oral PrEP for all individuals, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation who are at risk of HIV infection.\n- Event-Driven (ED) PrEP is currently recommended for all people born male who are not taking exogenous estradiol-based gender affirming hormones\n\n## 11.1 Indications for PrEP and Criteria for Eligibility\n\n### 11.1.1 Indications for PrEP\n\nPrEP is indicated for;\n\n- HIV uninfected persons at ongoing risk of HIV acquisition\n- Some risk situations that place one at ongoing risk include individuals or sexual partner/s who is/are:\n  - HIV positive and: not on ART, or on ART < 6 months, on ART with viral non-suppression, or on ART with suspected poor adherence\n  - In sero-discordant relationships trying to conceive\n  - Of unknown HIV status and at high-risk of HIV infection\n  - Engaging in transactional sex or sex work\n  - With history of recent or current sexually transmitted infections\n  - With recurrent use of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n  - With a history of sex whilst under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs\n  - Inconsistent or no condom use or unable to negotiate condom use during intercourse with persons of unknown HIV status\n  - Using injection drugs where needles and/or syringes are shared\n\n### 11.1.2 HIV Risk Assessment\n\nClients accessing health services should be screened for HIV risk and additionally provided with information on HIV prevention options available including the availability of PrEP. This is in addition to the use of HIV testing services (HTS), as clients are assessed for HIV risk before testing.\n\nThe risk assessment questions are enquiry of behavioural practices that may expose an individual to HIV (Table 11.2).\n\nA simple Risk Assessment Tool (RAST) is provided to guide the provider in generating a conversation about HIV risk. Screening for HIV risk should be integrated within other service delivery points. HIV negative individuals who answer ""yes"" to any of the screening questions\n\n\n# Table 11:1 HIV Screening questions\n\nScreening question refer to the past 6 months &#x26; include;\n\n- “Have you had sex with more than one person?”\n- “Have you had sex without a condom?”\n- “Have you had sex with anyone whose HIV status you do not know?”\n- “Are any of your partners at risk of HIV?”\n- “Have you had sex with a person who has HIV?”\n- “Have you received a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection?”\n- “Do you desire pregnancy?”\n- “Have you used or wanted to use PEP or PrEP for sexual exposure to HIV?”\n- “Have you injected drugs that were not prescribed by healthcare provider? If yes, did you use syringes, needles or other drug preparation equipment that had already been used by another person?”\n- “Have you received money, housing, food or gifts in exchange for sex?”\n- “Have you been forced to have sex against your will?”\n- “Have you been physically assaulted, including assault by a sexual partner?”\n\n# 11.1.3 Criteria for PrEP Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible for PrEP, individuals identified to be at risk of HIV infection from Risk Assessment must meet ALL the following criteria prior to initiating PrEP.\n\n- Confirmed HIV negative status through rapid antibody testing following the HTS algorithm.\n- Determine if the client is willing to take PrEP as prescribed. (This is done by adherence education and counselling on the PrEP regimen to be given, and assessing the client’s readiness to follow the regimen.)\n- Does not have a current or recent (within the past one month) illness consistent with acute HIV infection (fever, sore throat, muscle or joint pains, swollen glands, diarrhoea or headache) in combination with a preceding high-risk exposure for HIV.\n- No contraindication to use of any of the ARVs recommended for PrEP e.g., TDF +/- FTC (or 3TC) for those who choose oral PrEP.\n- Renal or liver disease\n- Clients with renal and liver disease should receive further clinical and laboratory tests, to determine the renal/liver function and extent of disease.\n\n# Other important factors for screening\n\n1. Gender based violence (GBV) screening: All clients accessing PrEP must be screened for gender-based violence, especially intimate partner violence (IPV), and appropriate intervention offered or client linked to appropriate.\n2. Mental Status Assessment: Psychological issues that may influence adherence should be assessed and addressed. It is important to carry out basic mental health evaluation and offer appropriate referral as necessary.', '## 11.2.2 Pre-initiation client education\n\nThe following components should be discussed prior to PrEP initiation:\n\n### Table 11.3: Client Education Checklist\n\n| Topic
